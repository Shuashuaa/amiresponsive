## Why?

As a front-end developer, hypotetically for most websites the responsiveness takes up 90% of the whole project. Imagine creating a full-stack app where all the functions are set up, the backend and database is finished, and the trial is on Monday. Now, imagine reading this and realizing that your website isn't yet responsive.
