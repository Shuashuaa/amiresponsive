## What(s) new? ✨

> Unlike version 1, in version 2 I still used Vue.js3 but with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS in replacement of Vuetify3. <br> The application size (gzipped) was reduced from <code style="font-size: 30px; color: orange;">***154.82kb***</code> to <code style="font-size: 30px; color: yellow;">***56.63kb***</code> minified as twice!.

## Roadmap ⏳
<!-- Future Features ⏳ -->

- [ ] Users can create an account
- [ ] Users created an account can save their outputs via inventory

## Why?
Most websites are now being used on different devices.
> As a front-end developer, hypothetically, responsiveness takes up about 90% of the whole project for most websites if implemented for multiple devices. Imagine creating a full-stack app where all the functions are set up, the backend and database are finished, and the trial is on Monday. Now, imagine reading this and realizing that your website isn't yet responsive.
